Please note this plugin is no longer supported. Wordpress versions 2.7 and up now provide a  similar feature. It is available for download to those utilizing older WP installs, however, this plugin ceased functionality with the release of Wordpress 2.7.1

WassUpLoader was created due to the fact that it was nearly impossible to upload images quickly and efficiently outside of a post or page. After building and utilizing WordPress sites for several years, it was apparent that an incredible amount of time was wasted dealing with images that were destined for the uploads folder yet need not be uploaded in this manner. We needed a quick way to get to the Upload screen.

History: During the WordPress 2.6 and younger years, it was necessary to visit the "Post" or "Page" screen of the admin area in order to access an upload screen. Why not just use an FTP ( File Transfer Protocol ) program? The answer is simple: we needed our clients to have access to these images within the Media panel. They not only needed to view the image but have the ability to change the title, name or description.

Some of you may be thinking that it's only necessary to upload images when creating a post thereby giving validity to the WordPress logic. This is not always the case for those developing WordPress as a CMS ( Content Management System ). The occasion arose that we needed to upload an image and not concern ourselves with the process of creating a post and often this occurred while working within the Appearance panel, forcing a lengthy walk through several admin pages in an effort to upload a single image. We solved this problem by adding an "Upload" link in the admin menu, now with a single click, you have access to the Upload screen.

Thanks to Wordpress 2.7, it is now possible to upload an image whenever you want without the need to visit a Post or Page. However, the issue still remains that it isn't instant. The user is still required to visit an uploading page. WassUpLoader removes even this final useless click by providing a popup window similar to the Post Uploader. It is in fact a direct link to the uploader screen. This prevents the user from leaving the page they are on which could, and has, resulted in a loss of work time. WordPress is getting closer but in the meantime, we are still offering this plugin to save time.

Giving credit where credit is due, we would like to thank Ozh from PlanetOzh for helping to finalize the plugin as it stands now. There are still bugs, none of which affect uploading, but we see no point in pushing forward with the coding as Wordpress is actively developing this concept further.

In current versions of WordPress this feature is a core function. This plugin has ceased with updates and is available for those users of WordPress 2.6.5 and older.

Yes, it uses the exact code. This is merely a shortcut.
